Run setup.m to open up simulink model and generate variables.

bicycle_drift_model_original follows strictly to the Stanford model, which assume small sliding angle (<30 degree)
bicycle_drift_model_accurate uses no approximation, should be more accurate under large sliding angle
bicycle_drift_model_modified uses different state definition [Uy r Ux], in order to get rid off division by zero. Not working properly.
